# JSON-split
Splits libraries from a combined JSON list document into their respective projects 

# This program seeks to take a combined list given in JSON format, and break down the "libraries" into individual lists based on a seprate document for multiple projects.  
In this fashion developers will only need to look at their projects list to determine the security vulnerabilities found by a third party code analyizer.  The new lists should include all vulnerabilities found per Librabry in use by project.
